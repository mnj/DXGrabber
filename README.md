# DXGrabber

Just a personal project / utility, feel free to copy anything if you find anything useful in this repo.

This is just a learning project for myself to test some things.

The UI/Dashboard can be found on http://localhost:8888

# Generate the dashboard file
run `npm run build` and copy the html file from the dist folder, to the same directory as the application.
